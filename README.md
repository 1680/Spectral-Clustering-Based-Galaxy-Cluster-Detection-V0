**Spectral-Clustering-Based-Galaxy-Cluster-Detection-V0**
*****************************************************
This is the code used in the manuscript entitled “Spectral Clustering for Optical Confirmation and Redshift Estimation of  X-ray Selected Galaxy Cluster Candidates in the SDSS Stripe 82" Eman Mahmoud, Ali takey and Amin Shoukry (submitted to Astronomy and Computing Journal).

**Purpose**
*******
The code adaopts a spectral clustering technique for developing a galaxy cluster finding algorithm to identify optical counterparts and to estimate photometric redshifts of X-ray selected cluster candidates.

This code is written in matlab (.m files) for the purpose of PhD research condcted in EGYPT-JAPAN university for science and technology (EJUST).

For the details of the input/ouput data and figures please check the manuscript (submitted to Astronomy and Computing Journal).

**Description**
***********
The input data files are organized in the “InputData” folder, and the code itself in the "Mfiles" folder and the ouput csv files and figures are in the “OutputResults” folder.

**Getting Started**
***************
The version of the code is prepared to be excuted under windows operating system.

When the code is run from the "Main" file , please confirm "Change Folder" to change matlab current folder to be the main folder.

***************
* I have modified the code by "Ingo Bürk" for the basic spectral clustering http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34412-fast-and-efficient-spectral-clustering
* I have rewitten the python script  for some functions of the cosmological calculator by "James Schombert" in matlab http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/CosmoCalc.html http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/CC.python.

**Note**
****
* Due to upload size limitations, we have seprated the data folders from the code folder. Please enclose them in the "InputData" folder at run time.
